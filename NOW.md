# Make Your Mind Up content engine: where it is right now

## What it is

The content engine is the production team behind makeyourmindup, the publication at makeyourmindup.ai: it finds what is worth saying, judges it with a blind panel, drafts it to the right subchannel's mandate, and turns it into the hero assets (the article, both cuts, thumbnails and covers; Growth makes the derived carousels, Notes and off-day posts), while Krish makes every decision that matters and nothing publishes itself. It is a Make Your Mind Up product, not a Mindmake one (Ruling, Krish, 2026-10-28); its `plan-week` is the one ideation path, and it runs makeyourmindup's kill list from a pinned copy (`vendor/makeyourmindup/kill-list/`). Two halves share one Supabase database: the content engine (`apps/control-plane`, its own Vercel project: the judges, drafting, the fact gate, the publish board, the ledger) and production (`scripts/ve.py`, the video engine; `scripts/quick-edit`, the fallback; `apps/renderer`; the Studio in `packages/` and `apps/runner`). Control Center is the desk Krish works at; the web publish board (content.krishraja.com) is the one surface he presses on. The publication has three subchannels, follow.the.money, mind.the.gap and under.the.hood, each held to a mandate in the database (`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`). This repository owns production, its standards and the hero assets; Growth-MakeYourMindUp owns posting, distribution and the derived carousels, Notes and memes (`docs/GROWTH-HANDOFF.md`, rulings of 26 and 28 October).

## Who it is for and why it matters for Mindmake

The engine is internal: it is how the publication reaches its reader, the face in `apps/control-plane/api/_mission.ts` ("a senior leader who will not admit to anyone that they are not ready for what is happening... leaders of PE and VC backed media, adtech and data businesses Krish already knows"). What it proves to that reader is that one person can run a publication with an AI production team and stay the editor: the machine proposes and shows its working, the person decides, and the machine learns only from what the person decided.

Stories a writer can carry without asking Krish:

- **Nobody was grading the judges.** The view comparing each judge with Krish's decision returned zero rows for two weeks, because no screen sent the panel's run id with his decision (`docs/STATE.md`).
- **Every mechanical check passed and the video was still rejected.** Eleven QC checks passed on the first ve proofs; Krish: "the visuals look like Microsoft Excel from 20 years ago". Design became a gate of its own (`config/failures.json`, F19).
- **Fewer rules, not more.** After weeks of one-piece rules, Krish asked for the engine to "know what kind of thing doesn't fly with me": the hard blocks shrank to eight nevers he confirmed, and everything else guides or is tested on engagement (`docs/production/THE_BAR.md`).

Objection it answers: "AI content is slop." Here is an engine that grades its judges against the editor, refuses to ship beneath his recorded rejections, and never counts its own actions as taste.

## Where it is right now (as of 2026-11-11)

<!-- north-star-state {"week_of":"2026-11-09","week_target":8,"current":2,"current_as_of":"2026-11-10","current_source":"Control Center content_ideas in the publication's series (2 published in the last 7 days)","urgency":4,"urgency_reason":"at 25% of this week's target"} --> **North Star number: U4, far behind.** Finished assets published through the engine per week (essays, Shorts, carousels), each passing the 10/10 judges: 2, against 8 this week, on the way to 30 by 30 November 2026. A bold swing every day; work that does not move the number waits.

- The historical video backfill is complete with nothing unresolved: 16 of 18 YouTube uploads sit on their pieces, the launch Short and the Tuesday 3 November off-day meme (Krish: "a tuesday off day where we post a funny meme") belong to no piece. makeyourmindup.ai shows each piece's Watch and Short beside Read it (card option A, makeyourmindup#40). (2026-11-11)
- Every published piece now holds its YouTube video, and its Short where one exists, on its making record: 16 historical uploads reconciled with evidence and written on 11 November with Krish's yes (docs/plans/2026-11-11-publication-backfill, readback 16 of 16). Going forward the hourly publish watcher records each new upload from the @makeyourmind-up feed, and reads Substack's archive again: since about 6 November it had read 0 posts, because the archive API now wraps its posts. GET /api/publish/catalogue serves every piece's article, video and Short addresses to makeyourmindup.ai, which went live with real covers the same day (makeyourmindup#39). (2026-11-11)
- NOW.md stays under 14,000 bytes on main whichever job folds notes into it: the NOW.md trim workflow (.github/workflows/now-trim.yml) runs scripts/now_trim.py after the harness fold job, after Auto-merge and after any push to main touching NOW.md. (2026-11-10)
- The capability register (config/capabilities.json, 62 capabilities, docs/CAPABILITIES.md) is checked by npm run check:capabilities. The first style catalogue was withdrawn on Krish's rejection, and its replacement design is docs/plans/2026-11-10-video-style-system/STYLE-CATALOGUE.md (styles, moves and formats as three separate libraries). No pipeline behaviour changed. (2026-11-10)
- Pull requests no longer edit NOW.md, so they stop conflicting over it: CI's now-md-untouched job refuses a pull request that touches it (steward branches excepted), sessions close out through now-notes/, and auto-merge folds the notes and runs scripts/now_trim.py on main to keep the page under 14,000 bytes. (2026-11-10)
- All three Wed 11 devices pass Claude's still review (slot_machine round 3: typed lines never cropped, cream cabinet with a visible lever); Krish has every mock frame. Both 10 Nov takes are eye-corrected by Maxine (short $0.015, long $0.093, 60 s chunks; off the lens 68 to 61 s and 247 to 209 s). (2026-11-10)
- ve closes on the statement card (6 s); Krish's engine approval for Wed 11 Nov is recorded, scoped to the engine only. (2026-11-10)
- ve has four new pieces for the Fri 13 Nov 5-minute cut, built by Codex from cards and checked here: the WINDOW layout (his face in a rounded corner window over full-bleed footage, easing between full frame and window), wall_screen (a real page flown off the office wall to full frame, its line marked), quota_chart (the medical-device study: questions bunch at the target, the junk third, the target halved, sales up 7%) and agent_swarm (ten agents on one comment, the token meter, the rank). (2026-11-10)
- house end card is direction C, "Built to help you decide.", filmed 6 s by kit; wide frame never splits a word (docs/production/CLOSING.md). (2026-11-10)
- **ve is the video engine on main; quick-edit stays the fallback until ve passes Phase 3** (`docs/ve/ENGINE.md`, `docs/ve/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/ve/STATUS.md`). From 9 Nov one production round: `ve proof` shows the hardest beat moving on his own take, and `ve render` refuses a whole cut until he presses Approve proof; the day tab carries four presses (Sign storyboard with a `ve expect` sheet, Pick a style, Approve proof, Approve cut) in `meta.making.gates`. Five lessons of the killed Thursday 5 Nov cut are guards in `scripts/velib/guards.py`, binding from 9 Nov. (2026-11-04)

## What changed recently

- 2026-11-11 one unresolved upload waits on Krish, the 3 November Short gJr6lwb-myE, which matches no piece.
Older lines: `docs/history/2026-11-11-NOW-moved-1.md`, `docs/history/2026-11-10-NOW-moved-8.md`, `docs/history/2026-11-10-NOW-moved-7.md`, `docs/history/2026-11-10-NOW-moved-6.md`, `docs/history/2026-11-10-NOW-moved-5.md`, then `docs/history/2026-11-10-NOW-moved-4.md` (it lists the earlier `*-NOW-*.md` files) and `LOG.md`.


## What is next and what is waiting on Krish

- Next (2026-11-11): confirm the publish watcher's next hourly run marks the 9 November piece published and the Disney card gains its Watch and Short.
- House close (2026-11-10): kit and ve close on the statement card, "Built to help you decide." (`docs/production/CLOSING.md`). Krish approved the engine change for Wed 11 Nov (`docs/plans/2026-11-11-wednesday/ve/engine-exceptions.json`). He hears the first cut with it at full size.
- Eye contact (2026-11-09): Wednesday runs `ve eyeline` per take (each has its own Maxine copy); visible contact needs the recording fix in EYE_CONTACT.md.
- Fri 13 Nov pre-production sheet (2026-11-07): both takes on the making record (Recorded: done); takes heard against the script (`docs/plans/2026-11-09-week/fri-takes-vs-script.md`: short take says "delegate" for "delete" and adds an unsupported "AI costs halved"; long take calls Hanoi "exaggerated" and changes the close line); the held 4 Nov send closed honestly (sent 06:46 on his words, no reader read-back ever passed). Sheet A to G sent to Krish as files and written as `docs/plans/2026-11-09-week/fri-preproduction/creative.json`. Waiting on Krish: Sign creative, and the 4-second pickup for "delete". Nothing is built before he signs.
- 16 Nov week (2026-11-09): board picked and published (Mon Oracle widened, Wed build vs buy, Fri AI after the midterms). Monday's lock signed 10 Nov: its long cut runs a few minutes over 5 and the article longer, to carry the midterm data-centre backlash. Next: one session per day from `docs/plans/2026-11-16-week/HANDOVER.md`.
- Waiting on Krish (as of 2026-10-29): Control Center's `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs Contents: write and Actions: read on this repository for the make press; whether the $15 cap gets a reader; the Buffer plan (due 31 October); OUR TEST or MY TEST on a video label he presents; "we" in article titles while video titles keep "I".
- Waiting on Krish (as of 2026-10-29, Wave 2 and 3 production): by ear, the levels and a sound-effect set; Gate 2 on face-with-proof frames and six devices; 5 to 10 golden frames; 20 minutes on 9 Nov scoring shadow cuts. His 29 Oct answers and the home-computer steps: the handover above.
- Krish declined required status checks on `main` (2026-10-25: "No merge checks."): `auto-merge.yml` merges every PR on green CI; no hand merges (2026-11-03).
- North Star check (2026-11-11): holds.

## Do not trust

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/ENGINE_SECRETS_HANDOVER.md` and `docs/CAROUSEL_ENGINE_STATE.md` in the passages `docs/STUDIO.md` lists as stale (audited 2026-09-25).
- `docs/STATE.md` below its 29 October section, and `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/STUDIO.md`, where they predate the code: none was checked against the commits from 2026-10-22 on (ve, the floor, taste by venture, the Sunday loop, zero routines).
- `.agents/skills/mindmake-video` where it routes work into The Money of AI or Built With AI: correct for the Studio's series, wrong as a description of the publication.
- Any document that names Descript as the script reader (teleprompter.com since 2026-10-12), a 3-minute long cut (5 minutes since 2026-10-19), a series line or a weekly deep cut (retired 2026-10-21), or a publish board built as a Claude artifact (the web board since 2026-10-19).
- Any document that calls the publication or this engine Mindmake's (superseded 2026-10-28), gives it two channels (2026-09-25), or names a Claude routine as a scheduler (2026-10-29).
- Everything in `docs/history/`.
