# Make Your Mind Up content engine: where it is right now

## What it is

The content engine is the production team behind makeyourmindup, the publication at makeyourmindup.ai: it finds what is worth saying, judges it with a blind panel, drafts it to the right subchannel's mandate, and turns it into the hero assets (the article, both cuts, thumbnails and covers), while Krish makes every decision that matters and nothing publishes itself. It is a Make Your Mind Up product, not a Mindmake one (Ruling, Krish, 2026-10-28); its `plan-week` is the one ideation path, and it runs makeyourmindup's kill list from a pinned copy (`vendor/makeyourmindup/kill-list/`). Two halves share one Supabase database: the content engine (`apps/control-plane`, its own Vercel project: the judges, drafting, the fact gate, the publish board, the ledger) and production (`scripts/ve.py`, the video engine; `scripts/quick-edit`, the fallback; `apps/renderer`; the Studio in `packages/` and `apps/runner`). Control Center is the desk Krish works at, and its Content tab holds the one live Publish Board, the one surface he presses on (Ruling, Krish, 2026-11-11; the old board pages redirect to it since 2026-11-13). The publication has three subchannels, follow.the.money, mind.the.gap and under.the.hood, each held to a mandate in the database (`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`). This repository owns production, its standards and the hero assets; Growth-MakeYourMindUp owns posting, distribution and the derived carousels, Notes and memes (`docs/GROWTH-HANDOFF.md`, rulings of 26 and 28 October).

## Who it is for and why it matters for Mindmake

The engine is internal: it is how the publication reaches its reader, the face in `apps/control-plane/api/_mission.ts` ("a senior leader who will not admit to anyone that they are not ready for what is happening... leaders of PE and VC backed media, adtech and data businesses Krish already knows"). What it proves to that reader is that one person can run a publication with an AI production team and stay the editor: the machine proposes and shows its working, the person decides, and the machine learns only from what the person decided.

Stories a writer can carry without asking Krish:

- **Nobody was grading the judges.** The view comparing each judge with Krish's decision returned zero rows for two weeks, because no screen sent the panel's run id with his decision (`docs/STATE.md`).
- **Every mechanical check passed and the video was still rejected.** Eleven QC checks passed on the first ve proofs; Krish: "the visuals look like Microsoft Excel from 20 years ago". Design became a gate of its own (`config/failures.json`, F19).
- **Fewer rules, not more.** After weeks of one-piece rules, Krish asked for the engine to "know what kind of thing doesn't fly with me": the hard blocks shrank to eight nevers he confirmed, and everything else guides or is tested on engagement (`docs/production/THE_BAR.md`).

Objection it answers: "AI content is slop." Here is an engine that grades its judges against the editor, refuses to ship beneath his recorded rejections, and never counts its own actions as taste.

## Where it is right now (as of 2026-11-14)

<!-- north-star-state {"week_of":"2026-11-09","week_target":8,"current":3,"current_as_of":"2026-11-12","current_source":"Control Center content_ideas in the publication's series (3 published in the last 7 days)","urgency":4,"urgency_reason":"at 38% of this week's target"} --> **North Star number: U4, far behind.** Finished assets published through the engine per week (essays, Shorts, carousels), each passing the 10/10 judges: 3, against 8 this week, on the way to 30 by 30 November 2026. A bold swing every day; work that does not move the number waits.

- There never were approved Monday 16 scripts to recover (a 13 Nov search of Teleprompter, every branch, Drive, the board and his messages found none), so the earlier "When Krish's own approved Monday scripts are recovered" next step was wrong. Monday 16's scripts are rewritten from the signed lock and recorded on the piece (making.py scripts): the long cut at 1,185 words (about 8 minutes, lifted by config/long-cuts.json) and the 90-second at 195, both passing story_check, the kill list, the copy lint and the voice gate, read by two rounds of three fresh readers (every retelling matched the point), with the storyboard and the fact check filed on the piece. The lock's "4 in 10 dollars from outside" had no outside source, so the scripts say FactSet's "about one in three dollars is borrowed"; his Approve on the scripts is asked as his yes to that change. Monday's motion style is re-pointed from ladder (rejected 13 Nov) to eating-jobs-ladder. (2026-11-14)
- The off-day reader no longer refuses the week of 16 Nov. Tuesday held six options a session wrote and a seventh from the Inspiration card Krish ticked, and week_plan.read_offdays counted all seven against the day's 2 to 6, so the gate and the hash test failed while the board's view drew all seven. An option from his tick (from_inspiration) now rides on top of the day's 2 to 6 and keeps its id; closed and decided options still count, as the view draws them on the day. What the live board shows is unchanged. (2026-11-14)
- Every script now ends on "The full story is free at makeyourmindup.ai." (SCRIPT_CLOSE_LINE, one place in the house rules), which passes the voice check, because the old last line failed it on every script (Ruling, Krish, 2026-11-14: "stick to voice check"); story_check.py refuses the old line by name, the voice-close guard (check:voice-close, in verify) fails the build if the banned phrase comes back into a rule, prompt, skill or lint, and the 16 and 17 Nov drafts on main end on the new line. A long cut may now run past 825 words for one piece, to at most 1,200 (about 8 minutes), only when its signed lock asks and config/long-cuts.json says why (Ruling, Krish, 2026-11-14: "lift if worth it"); Monday 16's piece is lifted to about 8 minutes, and the Scripts step on the board names the length and the reason. (2026-11-14)
- **ve is the video engine on main; quick-edit stays the fallback until ve passes Phase 3** (`docs/ve/ENGINE.md`, `docs/ve/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/ve/STATUS.md`). From 9 Nov one production round: `ve proof` shows the hardest beat moving on his own take, and `ve render` refuses a whole cut until he presses Approve proof; the day tab carries four presses (Sign storyboard with a `ve expect` sheet, Pick a style, Approve proof, Approve cut) in `meta.making.gates`. Five lessons of the killed Thursday 5 Nov cut are guards in `scripts/velib/guards.py`, binding from 9 Nov. (2026-11-04)

## What changed recently

- 2026-11-13 docs/ve/cards/style-gaps/, apps/renderer/src/engine/devices/ (nine new devices, kinetic_stat ghost), scripts/velib/compile.py (style.sound), config/ve/sfx-candidates.json, docs/ve/INGREDIENTS.md.
Older lines: `docs/history/2026-11-14-NOW-moved-5.md` (it names every earlier move) and `LOG.md`.


## What is next and what is waiting on Krish

- Next (2026-11-14): Krish approves Monday's scripts on the live board (Content tab, Mon 16) or in his own words, which sends them to Teleprompter, so he can record on Sunday.
- House close (2026-11-10): kit and ve close on the statement card, "Built to help you decide." (`docs/production/CLOSING.md`). Krish approved the engine change for Wed 11 Nov (`docs/plans/2026-11-11-wednesday/ve/engine-exceptions.json`). He hears the first cut with it at full size.
- Wed 11 (2026-11-11): approved in Krish's own words (picks/yes-wed-words); the board reads it as ready to post, both cuts and the pack in its 3 Posts folder.
- Eye contact (2026-11-09): Wednesday runs `ve eyeline` per take (each has its own Maxine copy); visible contact needs the recording fix in EYE_CONTACT.md.
- Fri 13 Nov pre-production sheet (2026-11-07): both takes on the making record (Recorded: done); takes heard against the script (`docs/plans/2026-11-09-week/fri-takes-vs-script.md`: short take says "delegate" for "delete" and adds an unsupported "AI costs halved"; long take calls Hanoi "exaggerated" and changes the close line); the held 4 Nov send closed honestly (sent 06:46 on his words, no reader read-back ever passed). Sheet A to G sent to Krish as files and written as `docs/plans/2026-11-09-week/fri-preproduction/creative.json`. Waiting on Krish: Sign creative (`creative.json`, `signed: null` on 12 Nov); the pickup for "delete" was recorded on 9 Nov.
- 16 Nov week (2026-11-09): board picked and published (Mon Oracle widened, Wed build vs buy, Fri AI after the midterms). Monday's lock signed 10 Nov: its long cut runs a few minutes over 5 and the article longer, to carry the midterm data-centre backlash. Next: one session per day from `docs/plans/2026-11-16-week/HANDOVER.md`.
- Waiting on Krish (checked 2026-11-12, 14:00 UTC): his Approve on Thu 12's `beststicker` on the live board (the Home Depot rethink he signed off in a session, filed in 3 Posts and carrying Tue 17's `auditrule`; the live view reads "Idea: waiting on your Approve"), and an answer on `frenemies` (Tue 17) and `ownref` (Thu 19), which have no outcome in `idea_outcomes`; a sound-effect set (`config/sfx-approved.json` approves none); golden frames (all 10 slots of `config/ve/golden-frames.json` empty, at least 5 wanted); Gate 2 on face-with-proof at 16:9 (`config/ve/design-lock.json`) (each still needs its review card on his Publish Board, with samples he can see and hear; not built yet). The music levels are no longer waiting: he approved them as they are on 12 Nov. `docs/STATE.md`, "Waiting on Krish".
- Krish declined required status checks on `main` (2026-10-25: "No merge checks."): `auto-merge.yml` merges every PR on green CI; no hand merges (2026-11-03).
- North Star check (2026-11-14): holds.

## Do not trust

- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` in the passages `docs/STUDIO.md` ("The detailed Studio documents") lists as stale. (`docs/CAROUSEL_ENGINE_STATE.md` is a retired stub since 2026-11-13; its record is in `docs/history/`.)
- `.agents/skills/mindmake-video` where it routes work into The Money of AI or Built With AI: correct for the Studio's series, wrong as a description of the publication.
- Any document that names Descript as the script reader (teleprompter.com since 2026-10-12), a 3-minute long cut (5 minutes since 2026-10-19), a series line or a weekly deep cut (retired 2026-10-21), or a publish board built as a Claude artifact, or the web board at content.krishraja.com as the live one (it was the board from 2026-10-19, a read-only archive from 2026-11-11, and is retired since 2026-11-13, every address redirecting to the live board in Control Centre's Content tab).
- Any document that calls the publication or this engine Mindmake's (superseded 2026-10-28), gives it two channels (2026-09-25), or names a Claude routine as a scheduler (2026-10-29).
- Everything in `docs/history/`.
