# kinetic_stat ghost: a count-down leaves a ghost of the value it left

## Goal
From the eating-its-own-jobs cut. Add an optional `ghost: true` param to the existing device `kinetic_stat`: when it counts down, the previous value stays behind at 25% opacity, offset up 8 px, struck through in the mono role, for the rest of the beat. Without the param the device draws exactly as before (houseGolden.test.ts). Test: the ghost exists only when asked and only after a count.

Per devices/CONTRACT.md: index.tsx, state.ts, schema.ts, fixture.json, device.test.ts; register in registry.ts and config/ve/devices.json.

## Contract
Device rules: apps/renderer/src/engine/devices/CONTRACT.md. One clock (useCurrentFrame only in apps/renderer/src/engine/clock.ts). Pure functions of props, no Math.random, no wall clock. Colour roles from tokens, never raw hex. Every number carries its producer. In a layout region (kit/layout.ts isRegion, kit/staging.ts) the device lays out at its natural size and grows to fill the region (kit/regionFit.tsx).

## Motion style: One object carries the story (from the eating-its-own-jobs cut) (eating-jobs-ladder, untested)
One object, a career ladder, carries the whole piece: every number is counted onto, beside or in place of a part of it, on a vignetted ink desk or in a butter tray over his chest, and every scene that steps away ends by turning back into the ladder, changed.
Build to these rules; brand roles (config/ve/brand-tokens.json) and the design lock win where they differ.
- one through-line object for the whole piece, changed on screen, never replaced
- numbers roll onto the object on the enter curve and land on their word
- a slow push holds every panel; nothing holds still
- every change is a 10-frame crossfade on its word; no slide or whip exits
- mint marks only the answer; the series colour is never a warning
Never:
- figures or icons acting out a sentence
- on-screen words repeating what he says
- eyebrow labels, kickers or asterisks
- a hard cut between panels except into the end card

## Acceptance (every command must exit 0 inside your sandbox)
npx vitest run apps/renderer/src/engine/devices/kinetic_stat
npx vitest run apps/renderer/src/engine
node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit --pretty false

## Return
Your final message is only JSON matching config/ve/task-result.schema.json:

Stop after two failed attempts at the same acceptance command and report the failure in open_questions.
